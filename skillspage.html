                I currently have experience working with Python, HTML, and CSS. I have many skills that I could be able 
            to contribute to your company. The most valuable I believe would be my extreme discipline. Discipline is a 
            very important attribute I believe that what you get out of me as a disciplined employee is an employee that 
            never shows up late to work, follows the directions from supervisors or those that are above me in authority. 
            I believe that because I have discipline it helps my ability to focus and contribute and be the best and most 
            productive worker I can be. Another Skill that I feel like I would be able to contribute to the company is 
            my ability to interact with those around me in a positive an uplifting way. I love to talk to others and 
            develop relationships with others and feel like that is an important way to have a successful team. 
            If everyone has this connection with each other then, they will try their best to help each other be 
            as successful as possible. The value of someone that helps bring everyone together is very important because 
            if everyone is united on a personal level, they will be able to find success on professional level as well. 
            I have worked on and completed many different projects including building this website. I have designed 
            and help create a website homepage for a rafting company and I was able to use CSS to make it look great and 
            make it a pleasant experience for the user to interact with. I have also limited experience of Python, my 
            most functional program that I coded using Python, was a word game that used your inputs and gave you hints 
            to help you find the word out with a limited number of guesses, it is very similar to the very popular game called 
            Wordle. I was also able to use a json file to import a library of every 5-letter word in the English dictionary.
